## Programming
___

### Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
##### A note on Angular Projects - Angular is a framework from which web applications can be made quickly and efficiently. The application root is the 'src' directory. Within the 'src/app/componenets' dir you will find basic page components with an HTML, CSS, and TypeScript file. These components are the guts of an Angular application.

[Angular Project - Bush Machinery](../master/Programming/Angular_Projects/bushMachinery) - This Angular7 project was made in one day. This was created to show my proficiency and speed with which I work to get a job done quickly and done well.

### C# Programs
##### I started programming with C# in Nov 2017, and since that time I have implemented Rest APIs, Canny Edge Detection, and Statistical Libraries (For Artificial Neural Nets). I still have more to learn, but am growing my knowledgebase quickly.
