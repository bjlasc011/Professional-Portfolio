## Programming
___

### Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
##### A note on Angular Projects - Angular is a framework from which web applications can be made quickly and efficiently. The application root is the 'src' directory. Within the 'src/app/componenets' dir you will find basic page components with an HTML, CSS, and TypeScript file. These components are the guts of an Angular application.

[Angular Project - Bush Machinery](../master/Programming/Angular_Projects/bushMachinery) - This Angular7 project was made in one day. This was created to show my proficiency and speed with which I work to get a job done quickly and done well.

[Angular Project - Karoline Cakes](../master/Programming/Angular_Projects/KarolineCakes) - This project was also created using Angular7 and Angular Material. Karolines Cakes was the business that was studied in my system analysis class at U of L and consisted of creating a system from requirements gathering to prototype. This is the prototype from that project, the rest of the analyis documentation can be found

### App Demos

##### LG&E's Training Tracker Demmo Video
I was on this project for the final 6 months of this project before doing final user stories and UATs (User Acceptance Testing) and puhsing to production. This application is used by company employees to enter completed training for compliance purposes. This application sends automatic emails and interfaces with PeopleSoft.

##### LG&E's HR Interview Builder
HR Interview Builder is LG&E's first fully dedicated Agile project in an effort to begin transition from waterfall development to the Agile methodology. I am one of two devolopers on this project and am responsible for the UI design and all front end coding. In this project I have done some API development in C#. This utilizes LG&E's corprate framework and session authentication as well as interfacing with IBMs Brass Ring database. 

This app will be both mobile and browser. It will be used to complete interview questionnaires, candidate evaluations, and act as a staffing services hub to manage all requisitions. HR Interview Builder will also be the system of record to prepare the company in case of legal action for Hiring Practice claims.

### C# Programs
##### I started programming with C# in Nov 2017, and since that time I have implemented Rest APIs, Canny Edge Detection, and Statistical Libraries (For Artificial Neural Nets). I still have more to learn, but am growing my knowledgebase quickly.

[Basic C# Programs](../master/Programming/C_Sharp) - these programs are some of the basic programs written in my software development classes

[Statistics Library](../master/Programming/C_Sharp_Statistics_Library) - this is a C# library project that can be referenced in other projects (DLL). This library covers advanced statistical functions such as z-score calculations, rare event calculations, and confidence intervals as well as standard deviations for normally distributed samples.

[Video Processing - Canny Edge Detection](../master/Programming/CannyEdgeDetector) - this C# web form application is my experimentation with image processing algorithms and edge detection. This program uses your web cam, processes the input smooths the images using a Gaussian filter, translates to a grayscale, resizes for performance, then finds contrours given various thresholds, then these thresholds are drawn to each frame. All of this is done in near realtime. Next step will be to use SIFT/SURF feature extraction.
